# Introduction

Some of you might be familiar with using an IPython shell to run the code line by line or creating custom Python Scripts in CAD applications.

In the previous session you were introduced to computational structural design. Let's recap:

For computational design an algorithmic language must be developed, the language is procedural. In other words geometric operations are introduced an described in discrete steps.

These steps are defined by computer programming which utlizes hardware and software to execute computations. In our case, these computations are useful for structural design.

The elements of algorithms are:

* variables
* loops
* conditionals
* functions
* objects

These elements can be used in different form of programming:

* visual programming i.e. Grasshopper
* procedural programming - Scripting
* object-oriented programming - OOP

The Computational Structural Design Class will introduce Scripting and Object-Oriented Programming through the Jupyter Notebook.

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that you can use to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text. The name itself comes from the core supported programming languages: Julia, Python, and R.

For more information on the project itself, visit [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org).
