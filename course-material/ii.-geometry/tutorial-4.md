## A. Geometry Data

### A1. Describe a point in CAD

A point in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system can be represented by 3 numbers. Describing the values along x, y and z axes. For example, in Rhino and Grasshopper, a point can be created numerically by inputing 3 values in a "Create Point" container.

\
![](../../2\_Geometry/Tutorial4/img/geo\_pt\_gh.png)example of "Create Point" container in Rhinoceros Grasshopper 3D\


We will do the same, utilizing our Jupyter Notebook interface.

### A2. Describe a Point by Python list

Similarly a list `[x, y, z]` can describe a point in Python. The three numbers represent the xyz coordinates of the point. Since a point is described as a list, the value in the list can be retrieved, modified, and updated by accessing the corresponding index of the list. Here we create a point `x=0, y=1, z=1` and change the coordinate `y=5`.

```python
# xyz coordinates of the point
my_point = [0, 5, 2]  
print("y coordinate of my_point is", my_point[1])

# re-assign the y coordinates 5
my_point[1] = 5  
print("xyz coordinates of my_point are", my_point)
```

```
y coordinate of my_point is 5
xyz coordinates of my_point are [0, 5, 2]
```

### A3. Geometry Data Summary

Besides point, basic geometry types - such as vector, line, plane - can be described numerically in Python by **lists of values**. The length of the list corresponds to the number of dimensions of the space the geometry resides in. In 3D space, the list contains 3 elements. The following table illustrates the data used to describe 3D geometries numerically.

| Geometry | Data                                               | Description                 |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| point    | \[x, y, z]                                         |                             |
| vector   | \[x, y, z]                                         |                             |
| line     | (\[x1, y1, z1], \[x2, y2, z2])                     | (start point, end point)    |
| plane    | (\[x0, y0, z0], \[xn, yn, zn])                     | (origin, normal)            |
| circle   | \[(\[x0, y0, z0], \[xn, yn, zn]), r]               | \[(origin, normal), radius] |
| polyline | (\[x1, y1, z1], \[x2, y2, z2], \[x3, y3, z3, ...]) | collection of points        |
| polygon  | (\[x1, y1, z1], \[x2, y2, z2], \[x3, y3, z3, ...]) | collection of points        |
| frame    | (\[x0, y0, z0], \[x1, y1, z1], \[x2, y2, z2])      | \[origin, vector, vector]   |

## B. Geometry Class

A geometry type can be described by data. We can use a **Class** as a constructor, a template, or a "blueprint" to create **Objects** of a certain geometry type. An **Object** is an instance of a **Class** and it shares all **attributes** and the behavior of the Class. Classes are used frequently in Python scripting. A class can not only store data, but also define methods (an object-oriented programming term for functions) alongside the data that they operate on and produce.

In the following session, we will learn Python Class by creating our own **Point class**. Then we will use the class to create a **Point object**, which represents the point `x=0, y=1, z=1`.

### B1. Point Class

#### B1\_a. Create a Class

Class definition cannot be empty. Put the `pass` statement to avoid getting an error.

```python
class Point:
    """ Point class"""
    pass

pt = Point()  # instantiate an object of Point
print(pt) # by default, print the name of the objectâ€™s class and the address of the object. 
```

```
<__main__.Point object at 0x7fb6c808a0a0>
```

#### B1\_b. `__init__()` function

All classes have a function called `__init__()`, which is always executed when the class is being initiated. We can pass some initial values to the class by calling the `__init__()` function. Before the parameters `x`, `y`, `z`, there is a `self`, which refers to the object itself. Then, we need to create new fields also called `x`, `y`, `z`. Notice `self.x` and `x` are two different variables even though they are both called `x`. You can view the dotted notation `self.x` as the attribute of your Point object, and the other x is a local variable.

```python
class Point:
    """ Point class"""
    
    def __init__(self, x, y, z):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z

pt = Point(1, 1, 0) # create a point object
print("xyz coordinates are:", pt.x, pt.y, pt.z)
```

```
xyz coordinates are: 1 1 0
```

#### B1\_c. Object Method

Now let's add a method to Point class to translate the point. What we want is to move or "translate" the point. The method modifies the object attribute `self.x`, `self.y`, `self.z` by adding the translation distance along the corresponding axis.

```python
class Point:
    """ Point class"""
    
    def __init__(self, x, y, z):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z
    
    def translate(self, vec_x, vec_y, vec_z):
        """Translate this point along a 3d vector"""
        self.x += vec_x
        self.y += vec_y
        self.z += vec_z

pt = Point(1, 1, 0) # create a point object
print("xyz coordinates before translation are:", pt.x, pt.y, pt.z) 
pt.translate(1,3,1) 
print("xyz coordinates after translation are:", pt.x, pt.y, pt.z) 
```

```
xyz coordinates before translation are: 1 1 0
xyz coordinates after translation are: 2 4 1
```

#### B1\_d. Modify Object Properties

Properties on objects can be modified.

```python
pt.x = 3
print("xyz coordinates after modification are:", pt.x, pt.y, pt.z) 
```

```
xyz coordinates after modification are: 3 4 1
```

### B2. Use the Point Class from COMPAS

COMPAS contains a [Point](https://compas.dev/compas/latest/api/generated/compas.geometry.Point.html?highlight=point#compas.geometry.Point) class which is similar to the one we have created. However, it contains more object methods which have already been developed. In a COMPAS Point class, a Point has three parameters, `x`, `y`, `z`. They could be accessed through indexing as well as through `.x`, `.y`, and `.z` attributes.

![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-M730QpQnbAMvz44bqhc%2F-MMzyUtFsDByqwGgOo8D%2F-MN-4caIa6sDF5e1YGok%2Fimage.png?alt=media\&token=2c8d3140-e57b-49a2-8f16-d89ba351319c)

```python
from compas.geometry import Point

my_point = Point(0, 1, 1)  # create a point object
print(my_point.y)  # attribute y of point
print(my_point[1] == my_point.y)

my_point.y = 5  # reassign the attribute y
print(my_point) # Point class contains a class function that prints the summary of the object
```

```
1.0
True
Point(0.000, 5.000, 1.000)
```

### B3. Geometry Classes in COMPAS

COMPAS provides a number of ready-to-use primitive objects. Available primitive objects include `Point`, `Vector`, `Line`, `Plane`, `Polyline`, `Polygon`, `Circle`, `Frame`, etc. All COMPAS primitives can be used interchangeably with native Python objects as input for geometry functions and object methods. For a complete overview, you can visit the [API Reference](https://compas.dev/compas/latest/api/compas.geometry.html).

\


| Geometry Object | COMPAS Class                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| point           | point = Point(x, y, z)               |
| vector          | vector = Vector(x, y, z)             |
| line            | line = Line(point, point)            |
| plane           | plane = Plane(point, vector)         |
| circle          | circle = Circle(plane, radius)       |
| polyline        | polyline = Polyline(points)          |
| polygon         | polygon = Polygon(points)            |
| frame           | frame = Frame(point, vector, vector) |

\


```python
from compas.geometry import Point, Line

line_1 = Line([0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0])
line_2 = Line(Point(0, 0, 0), Point(2, 0, 0))

print(line_1 == line_2)
```

```
True
```

***

## C. Geometry and Visualization

### C1. Visualize a Point

The point we have created in the last session is a virtual object, now we will visualize it

```python
from compas.geometry import Point
from compas_plotters import Plotter

my_point = Point(1, 1, 0)

# visualize the Point
plotter = Plotter(show_axes=True)
plotter.add(my_point)
plotter.show()
```

\
![](week\_4\_files/week\_4\_17\_0.png)visualize a point\


```python
from compas.geometry import Point
from compas_plotters import Plotter
from compas_plotters.artists import PointArtist

my_point = Point(1, 1, 0)
pointartist = PointArtist(my_point)

# visualize the Point
plotter = Plotter(show_axes=True)
plotter.add(my_point, pointartist)
plotter.show()
```

```

     61 return cls


DataArtistNotRegistered: No artist is registered for this data type: <class 'compas.geometry.primitives.point.Point'> in this context: None
```

After we generate the geometry objects, we can use a visualization interface to translate the information into a visual context. Firstly, We need a "drawing surface" - a canvas in 2D, or a scene in 3D. A 2D canvas can contain a number of shapes, which contains not only the geometric data - such as the coordinates, but also graphics context. Graphics context means objects that provide mechanisms for displaying the geometry, such as color, width of the curve.

#### TODO: add diagram about data, artist, plotter...

```python
# from IPython.display import display
# fig = plotter.figure
# display(fig)
```

### C2. Line

```python
from compas.geometry import Line
from compas_plotters import Plotter

# create a line
my_line = Line([0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0])

# visualize the line
plotter = Plotter(show_axes=True)
plotter.add(my_line, draw_points=False, draw_as_segment=True)
plotter.zoom_extents()
plotter.show()
```

\
![](week\_4\_files/week\_4\_22\_0.png)visualize a point\


### C3. Vector

A vector is a geometric object that has magnitude and direction. In Python, it could be represented through a list of XYZ components.

#### C3\_a. Vector Data

```python
my_vector = [1, 2, 0]  # xyz coordinates of the vector
```

A vector can be added, subtracted, multiplied by another vector. For example, here's the example to add two vectors in Python.

```python
vector1 = [1, 2, 0]
vector2 = [0, 1, 0]
vector3 = [vector1[i] + vector2[i] for i in range(3)]
print(vector3)
```

```
[1, 3, 0]
```

#### C3\_b. Geometric Operation Functions

compas.geometry provides geometric operation functions to simplify the use of basic Python operations. These functions always return native Python objects. The last example can be realized by using `compas.geometry.add_vectors`.

### TODO: add cross product

```python
from compas.geometry import add_vectors
vector1 = [1, 2, 0]
vector2 = [0, 1, 0]
vector3 = add_vectors(vector1, vector2)
print(vector3)
```

```
[1, 3, 0]
```

#### C3\_c. Vector Class

The COMPAS Vector class contains useful geometric properties and methods. Now let's create a Vector object and check its length. In Vector class, length is the attribute of the object.

```python
from compas.geometry import Vector
my_vector = Vector(1, 2, 0)
print(my_vector)
print(my_vector.length)
```

```
Vector(1.000, 2.000, 0.000)
2.23606797749979
```

A vector could also be constructed from start and end points. COMPAS geometry types could be used interchangeably with native Python types. Both a COMPAS Point object or a list composed of 3 components could be used as input.

```python
from compas.geometry import Point, Vector
my_vector = Vector.from_start_end(Point(0, 0, 0), Point(1, 2, 0))
# my_vector = Vector.from_start_end([0, 0, 0], [1, 2, 0]
print(my_vector)
print(my_vector == Vector(1, 2, 0))
```

```
Vector(1.000, 2.000, 0.000)
True
```

Operators such as + or \* involving COMPAS geometry objects always return a new COMPAS geometry object. For example, scaling my\_vector by 2 can use the class method Vector.scale(n) as well as \* 2.

```python
from compas.geometry import Vector
my_vector = Vector(1, 2, 0)
my_vector.scale(2)
print(my_vector)
print(my_vector == Vector(2, 4, 0))
print(my_vector == Vector(1, 2, 0) * 2)
```

```
Vector(2.000, 4.000, 0.000)
True
True
```

#### C3\_d: Exercise: Draw Vectors

Question: Given three points: pointA: \[0, 0, 0], pointB: \[0, 1, 0], pointC: \[3, 2, 0]. You need to draw three vectors as shown in the following picture.

\
![](../../2\_Geometry/Tutorial4/img/vectors.jpg)three vectors\


```python
from compas.geometry import Point
from compas_plotters import Plotter

# Point Geometry
point1 = Point(0, 0, 0)
point2 = Point(0, 1, 0)
point3 = Point(3, 2, 0)

# Plotter
plotter = Plotter(show_axes=True)

plotter.add(point1)
plotter.add(point2)
plotter.add(point3)

plotter.zoom_extents()
plotter.show()
```

\
![](week\_4\_files/week\_4\_37\_0.png)\


```python
from compas.geometry import Point
from compas_plotters import Plotter

# Point Geometry
point1 = Point(0, 0, 0)
point2 = Point(0, 1, 0)
point3 = Point(3, 2, 0)

vector1 = point2 - point1
vector2 = point3 - point2
vector3 = point3 - point1

# Plotter
plotter = Plotter(show_axes=True)

plotter.add(point1)
plotter.add(point2)
plotter.add(point3)

plotter.add(vector1, point=point1, color=(1, 0, 0))
plotter.add(vector2, point=point2, color=(0, 1, 0))
plotter.add(vector3, point=point1, color=(0, 0, 1))

plotter.zoom_extents()

# # save image
# import os
# HERE = os.getcwd()
# path = os.path.join(HERE, 'img/vectors.jpg')
# plotter.save(path) # call save before plotter.show; after plotter.show() is called, a new figure is created. 

plotter.show()
```

### C4. Polygon

A Polygon represents an ordered collection of points in space connected by straight line segments forming a closed boundary around the interior space. It has a closed boundary that separates its interior from the exterior.

```python
from compas.geometry import Polygon
from compas_plotters import Plotter

my_polygon = Polygon([[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0], [1, -1, 0]])

plotter = Plotter(show_axes=True)
plotter.add(my_polygon, edgecolor=(0, 0, 1), facecolor=(1, 1, 0))
plotter.zoom_extents()
plotter.show()
```

\
![](week\_4\_files/week\_4\_40\_0.png)\


```python
from compas.geometry import Polygon
from compas_plotters import Plotter

# Construct a regular polygon from a number of sides and a radius.
my_polygon = Polygon.from_sides_and_radius_xy(5, 2.0) 

plotter = Plotter(show_axes=True)
plotter.add(my_polygon, edgecolor=(0, 0, 1), facecolor=(0.7, 0.7, 1.0))
plotter.zoom_extents()
plotter.show()
```

\
![](week\_4\_files/week\_4\_41\_0.png)\


### C5. Polyline

A Polyline is a sequence of points connected by line segments. Different from a Polygon, a Polyline doesn't have an interior and an exterior.

```python
from compas.geometry import Polyline
from compas_plotters import Plotter

my_polyline = Polyline([[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0], [1, -1, 0]])

plotter = Plotter(show_axes=True)
plotter.add(my_polyline, color=(1, 0, 0), linewidth=3)
plotter.zoom_extents()
plotter.show()
```

\
![](week\_4\_files/week\_4\_43\_0.png)\


### C6. Circle

```python
from compas.geometry import Plane, Circle
from compas_plotters import Plotter

my_plane = Plane([2, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1])  # center and normal
my_circle = Circle(my_plane, 2)

plotter = Plotter(show_axes=True)
plotter.add(my_circle, edgecolor=(0, 0, 1), facecolor=(0, 1, 1), linewidth=3)

plotter.zoom_extents()
plotter.show()
```

\
![](week\_4\_files/week\_4\_45\_0.png)\


### C7. PointCloud

```python
from random import random

from compas.geometry import Pointcloud
from compas.utilities import i_to_rgb
from compas_plotters import Plotter

# Pointcloud Geometry
pcl = Pointcloud.from_bounds(10, 5, 0, 100)

# Plotter
plotter = Plotter(show_axes=True)

for point in pcl.points:
    plotter.add(point, facecolor=i_to_rgb(random(), normalize=True))

plotter.zoom_extents()
plotter.show()
```

## D. Geometry Operations

### D1. Transformation

A Transformation is a change in geometric shape, which is represented by a 4x4 transformation matrix. Here we will learn 3 typical transformations in COMPAS: translation, rotation and scale. A COMPAS geometry object can be transformed by calling the method .transform() or .transformed(). The former modifies the object in place, whereas the latter returns a new object.

#### D1\_a. Translation

Translation is to move the geometry, one of the most basic transformation types. The shape, size and orientation of the geometry remain the same.

```python
from compas.geometry import Translation
T = Translation.from_vector([1, 2, 3])
print(T)
```

```
[[    1.0000,    0.0000,    0.0000,    1.0000],
 [    0.0000,    1.0000,    0.0000,    2.0000],
 [    0.0000,    0.0000,    1.0000,    3.0000],
 [    0.0000,    0.0000,    0.0000,    1.0000]]
```

```python
from compas.geometry import Polygon, Translation
from compas_plotters import Plotter

# Construct a regular polygon from a number of sides and a radius.
my_polygon = Polygon.from_sides_and_radius_xy(5, 2.0) 
my_polygon.transform(T)

plotter = Plotter(show_axes=True)
plotter.add(my_polygon, edgecolor=(0, 0, 1), facecolor=(0.7, 0.7, 1.0))
plotter.zoom_extents()
plotter.show()
```

\
![](week\_4\_files/week\_4\_52\_0.png)\


.transformed() creates a new polygon.

```python
from compas.geometry import Polygon, Translation
from compas_plotters import Plotter

# Construct a regular polygon from a number of sides and a radius.
my_polygon = Polygon.from_sides_and_radius_xy(5, 2.0) 
my_polygon.transform(T)

my_polygon = Polygon.from_sides_and_radius_xy(5, 2.0)
T1 = Translation.from_vector([1, 2, 0])
T2 = Translation.from_vector([2, 1, 0])
my_polygon.transform(T1)
my_polygon2 = my_polygon.transformed(T2)

plotter = Plotter(show_axes=True)
plotter.add(my_polygon, edgecolor=(0, 0, 1), facecolor=(0.7, 0.7, 1.0))
plotter.add(my_polygon2, edgecolor=(0, 0, 1), facecolor=(1.0, 0.7, 1.0))

plotter.zoom_extents()
plotter.show()
```

\
![](week\_4\_files/week\_4\_54\_0.png)\


#### D1\_b. Rotation

Rotation is to rotate the geometry by a certain degree.

```python
import math as m
from compas.geometry import Polygon, Rotation
from compas_plotters import Plotter

# Construct a regular polygon from a number of sides and a radius.
my_polygon = Polygon.from_sides_and_radius_xy(5, 2.0) 
my_polygon.transform(T)

R = Rotation.from_axis_and_angle([0, 0, 1], m.radians(15))
my_polygon.transform(R)

plotter = Plotter(show_axes=True)
plotter.add(my_polygon, edgecolor=(0, 0, 1), facecolor=(0.7, 0.7, 1.0))
plotter.zoom_extents()
plotter.show()
```

\
![](week\_4\_files/week\_4\_56\_0.png)\


#### D1\_c. Scale

Scale is to enlarge or shrink the geometry by a scale factor.

```python
from compas.geometry import Polygon, Scale
from compas_plotters import Plotter

# Construct a regular polygon from a number of sides and a radius.
my_polygon = Polygon.from_sides_and_radius_xy(5, 2.0) 
my_polygon.transform(T)

S = Scale.from_factors([0.5, 1, 1])  # scale factors along X, Y, Z
my_polygon.transform(S)

plotter = Plotter(show_axes=True)
plotter.add(my_polygon, edgecolor=(0, 0, 1), facecolor=(0.7, 0.7, 1.0))
plotter.zoom_extents()
plotter.show()
```

\
![](week\_4\_files/week\_4\_58\_0.png)\


#### D1\_d. Frame

Frame plays an important role in transformation, especially in 3D. A frame defines a local coordinate system and transformation can be created between different coordinate systems represented by frames. Note that Frame is different from a Plane. A frame is defined by an origin and two axes, while a plane is defined by an origin and a normal vector.

```python
from compas.geometry import Frame, Transformation
f1 = Frame([1, 1, 1], [0.68, 0.68, 0.27], [-0.67, 0.73, -0.15])
T = Transformation.from_frame(f1)
print(T)
```

```
[[    0.6808,   -0.6688,   -0.2988,    1.0000],
 [    0.6808,    0.7282,   -0.0788,    1.0000],
 [    0.2703,   -0.1498,    0.9511,    1.0000],
 [    0.0000,    0.0000,    0.0000,    1.0000]]
```

```python
f2 = Frame([1, 1, 1], [0.68, 0.68, 0.27], [-0.67, 0.73, -0.15])
T = Transformation.from_frame_to_frame(f1, f2)
f1.transform(T)
print(f1 == f2)
```

### D2. Intersections

To compute intersections between primitives and/or shapes, use the intersection functions.

```python
from compas.geometry import intersection_line_plane
line = [1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1]
plane = [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]
intersection_line_plane(line, plane)
```

```
[1.0, 1.0, 0.0]
```

```python
from compas.geometry import Plane, intersection_line_plane
line = [1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1]
plane = Plane.worldXY()
intersection_line_plane(line, plane)
```

```
[1.0, 1.0, 0.0]
```
