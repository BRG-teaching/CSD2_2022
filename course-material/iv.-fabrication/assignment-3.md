## Design Brief

![© Roland Fischer](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

In order to apply the knowlege acquire throughout the CSD2  in a realistic design scenario, you will be asked to use all the techniques we will have presented throughout the course to design a shell structure in the public space of the Sechseläutenplatz in Zurich, Switzerland.&#x20;

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Opera4.jpeg)

Design a free-form shell for [Sechseläutenplatz in Zurich](https://goo.gl/maps/JaMvwPPMruYewLMFA). The surface of the shell may have a maximum area of 200 square meters and a maximum 16 meter span. The shell may land around, but not in or on the existing site obstacles (umbrellas, trees and dark grey areas). The shell must be inside the red area shown in the second image below. The height of the shell should be at least 2.5 meters, so that it can be used as a passageway as well as a covering for the plaza.

Tips and design considerations

* For my given site and my design intent, which method of RV2 pattern generation is appropriate?
* What types of existing boundary condition constraints do I need to taken into account?
* How does my pattern generation and modification strategies influence my choice of material and other fabrication and construction schemes?
* How can I control and modify the geometry of the force diagram to refine the shape of the Thrust Diagram?
* Have I considered how the landings and openings of the Thrust Diagram relate to the program and the intended use of the space underneath?

**Use the following 3Dmodel to develop your design.**

### Geometry, Rationalisation, and Materialisation





### Deliverables for the Form finding and Geometry, Rationalisation, and Materialisation

On the last CSD2 Course session, on May 19th, you will be asked to present your design proposals to the instructors . Before the start of Friday's 1st session, please compile the material below into a zip file (Your\_GroupName.zip), and upload it using the link in the header of this page.

### 1. Images(5-7)

* 16x9 format, 1920x1080 resolution min
* These images may include but are not limited to:
  * Site strategy diagrams
  * Concept sketches and design development
  * Pattern generation techniques and development
  * evolution and refinement of form and force diagrams
  * fabrication strategies and development
  * perspectives/renderings
* Your\_Group\_Name\_\_##.png

### 2. Presentation board

* Presentation board (16x9 format, 1920x1080 resolution min.) summarising the the design project
* This board can be an organized compilation or a collage of the 8-10 images from above
* YourLastName\_YourFirstName\_board.pdf (or jpg/png)

### 3. .rv2 session file (s)

* Final or a series of .rv2 session files&#x20;
* Your\_Group\_Name\_##.rv2

### 4. .3dm rhino file

Include Rhino files of the final design, including the shell geometry as well as any materialisation and fabrication developments.

* The Rhino file may be used interactively in your presentation
* To give an overview of materialization and fabrication developments
