# Syllabus

## 1. Learning goals

After successfully completing the course, the students will be able to:

1. design, form find and analyse compression-only shell structures using Thrust Network Analysis and RhinoVAULT 2 (RV2).
2. develop their computational design and algorithmic thinking.
3. code basic Python scripts using Jupyter Notebook.
4. use the COMPAS framework for processing computational geometry and materializing mesh data structures.
5. understand the basic principles of digital-design-to-fabrication pipeline and setup.
6. understand and develop skills in subtractive fabrication methods (CNC milling).
7. conceptualize and design efficient structural forms informed by fabrication constraints.
