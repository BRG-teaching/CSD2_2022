# Syllabus

{% hint style="danger" %}
* The course will be livestreamed [here](https://video.ethz.ch/live/lectures/hoenggerberg/hil/hil-e-8.html), and the recording of each class will be posted [here](https://video.ethz.ch/lectures/d-arch/2022/spring.html).
* Due to the interactive, hands-on nature of the course, the students are highly encouraged to attend the tutorials and work sessions in person to maximise interactions with the instructors and get the most out of the course.&#x20;

## 1. Learning goals

After successfully completing the course, the students will be able to:

1. design, form find and analyse compression-only shell structures using Thrust Network Analysis and RhinoVAULT 2 (RV2).
2. develop their computational design and algorithmic thinking.
3. code basic Python scripts using Jupyter Notebook.
4. use the COMPAS framework for processing computational geometry and materializing mesh data structures.
5. understand the basic principles of digital-design-to-fabrication pipeline and setup.
6. understand and develop skills in subtractive fabrication methods (CNC milling).
7. conceptualize and design efficient structural forms informed by fabrication constraints.

## 6. Communication

### Slack

Due to the hands-on, technical nature of the course's tutorial and exercises, [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ch/) will be used to provide real-time technical support, communication, and feedback. You can join the dedicated Slack workspace for the course [**here**](https://join.slack.com/t/csd12021/shared\_invite/zt-w7so4l0k-qo3pGvce6Tiaj8FwVimLwA).

### Email

In addition to Slack, directly emailing the lecturers or doctoral student instructors is, of course, also possible. The email addresses of the instructors can be found in the section [**Instructors**](instructors.md).

### Office hours

If you would like to get direct, in-person help or consultation, you can also contact one of the instructors to set up an appointment in the BRG corner of HIB E.  &#x20;

### GitHub issue tracker

You can also submit a formal request, question, feedback or comments using the dedicated issue tracker for the course: [https://github.com/BlockResearchGroup/CSD2\_2022/issues](https://github.com/BlockResearchGroup/CSD2\_2022/issues)
