# Syllabus

{% hint style="danger" %}
* The course will be livestreamed [here](https://video.ethz.ch/live/lectures/hoenggerberg/hil/hil-e-8.html), and the recording of each class will be posted [here](https://video.ethz.ch/lectures/d-arch/2022/spring.html).
* Due to the interactive, hands-on nature of the course, the students are highly encouraged to attend the tutorials and work sessions in person to maximise interactions with the instructors and get the most out of the course.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## 1. Learning goals

After successfully completing the course, the students will be able to:

1. design, form find and analyse compression-only shell structures using Thrust Network Analysis and RhinoVAULT 2 (RV2).
2. develop their computational design and algorithmic thinking.
3. code basic Python scripts using Jupyter Notebook.
4. use the COMPAS framework for processing computational geometry and materializing mesh data structures.
5. understand the basic principles of digital-design-to-fabrication pipeline and setup.
6. understand and develop skills in subtractive fabrication methods (CNC milling).
7. conceptualize and design efficient structural forms informed by fabrication constraints.

## 2. Course overview

### Modules

The course is divided into 4 modules, each with specific objectives and learning goals.

* **Module 1** - "Form Finding"
* **Module 2** - "Geometry"
* **Module 3** - "Materialisation"
* **Module 4** - "Fabrication"

### Tools







## 3. Class structure

Each module consists of three parts: a lecture, tutorials and work sessions.

## 5. Evaluation

### Grading

The students will be evaluated based on the completion of:

* Assignment 1 (individual)
* Assignment 2 (individual)
* Assignment 3 + presentation (in groups)

There is no final exam or design project. Each assignment will be assigned at the beginning of each module and will be due at the beginning of the next module. The final grade for the course will be cumulative.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Late submission will NOT be accepted.**

In case of medical or family emergencies, please inform the instructors in advance.
{% endhint %}

Each assignment will be evaluated based on two criteria:

**1. Completeness of the tasks** - **** For each task of the assignment, completed files and specified deliverables should be submitted. &#x20;

**2. Communicating the process and results with clarity** - In computational research, communicating one's abstract ideas, technical procedures/approach and results are just as important as the research itself. For each assignment, the files mentioned above should be accompanied by a document (using the template provided, for each assignment), which answers the questions of the assignment and include any additional comments or remarks. The questions need to be answered with clear writing and supported by images, screenshots, hand sketches, or any other additional material.&#x20;

### Submissions

For each assignment, the students will be asked to submit a zipped folder that contains:

1. Completed files and deliverables
2. a PDF summarising and presenting the results of the assignment&#x20;

## 6. Communication

### Slack

Due to the hands-on, technical nature of the course's tutorial and exercises, [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ch/) will be used to provide real-time technical support, communication, and feedback. You can join the dedicated Slack workspace for the course [**here**](https://join.slack.com/t/csd22022/shared\_invite/zt-145lzu0lv-QKuFGwgYvwBXDn1q34SAOA).

### Email

In addition to Slack, directly emailing the lecturers or doctoral student instructors is, of course, also possible. The email addresses of the instructors can be found in the section [**Instructors**](instructors.md).

### Office hours

If you would like to get direct, in-person help or consultation, you can also contact one of the instructors to set up an appointment in the BRG corner of HIB E.  &#x20;

### GitHub issue tracker

You can also submit a formal request, question, feedback or comments using the dedicated issue tracker for the course: [https://github.com/BlockResearchGroup/CSD2\_2022/issues](https://github.com/BlockResearchGroup/CSD2\_2022/issues)
