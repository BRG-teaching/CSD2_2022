# Tools

For this course, we will be using [Rhino](https://www.rhino3d.com) 6+ for Windows. Although the tutorials and exercises can be completed using Rhino Mac, all the features of compas-RV2 will not be available for Mac (most importantly, the toolbar). Therefore, if you have an Apple computer, following the course content using Windows with a virtual machine is highly recommended.

We will be using two tools in this course:

{% content-ref url="tools/rv2.md" %}
[rv2.md](tools/rv2.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="tools/page-2.md" %}
[page-2.md](tools/page-2.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
