# compas-RV2

![](../.gitbook/assets/plugin\_title\_slides\_compas\_rv2.jpg)

The RhinocerosÂ® plug-in RhinoVAULT, developed by Dr. Matthias Rippmann at the Block Research Group at ETH Zurich, emerged from research on structural form finding using the Thrust Network Analysis (TNA) approach to intuitively create and explore compression-only structures.

Using reciprocal diagrams, RhinoVAULT provides an intuitive, fast funicular form-finding method, adopting the same advantages of techniques such as Graphic Statics, but offering a viable extension to three-dimensional problems. Our goal is to share a transparent setup to let you not only create beautiful shapes but also to give you an understanding of the underlying structural principles.

compas-RV2 (RhinoVAULT 2) is an open-source research and development platform for funicular form-finding built with [**COMPAS**](https://compas-dev.github.io), a Python-based framework for computational research and collaboration in Architecture, Engineering, and Digital Fabrication.

compas-RV2 is a Rhino plugin that replaces RhinoVAULT for Rhino versions 6 and above. Unlike RhinoVAULT, compas-RV2 no longer relies on Rhino for its computational implementation. Instead, it is built entirely with open source packages from the COMPAS ecosystem and will, therefore, be available not only for Rhino and Grasshopper, but also for Blender and other tools with a Python scripting interface, and ultimately even in the browser.

## Download

For this course, we will be using **compas-RV2** version **1.4.7**, which can be downloaded [**here**](https://github.com/BlockResearchGroup/compas-RV2/releases/tag/v1.4.7).

## Installation instructions

Detailed instructions on how to install compas-RV2 are available [**here**](https://blockresearchgroup.gitbook.io/rv2/quick-start/windows-install).

{% hint style="danger" %}
In this class, we will be using **compas-RV2 in WINDOWS!** If you have a Mac, please set up a virtual machine with Windows using software like VMware.

VMware is offered for free by ETH (also Window and Rhinoceros), which is available through the [**ETH IT Shop**](https://itshop.ethz.ch/EndUser/Items/Home).



If you must use Mac... you will need to install compas-RV2 manually, by following the instructions carefully [**here**](https://blockresearchgroup.gitbook.io/rv2/documentation/dev-installs/manual-install).
