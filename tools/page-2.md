# Jupyter Notebook

Throughout the CSD2 course, Jupyter notebooks will be used in all the next sessions, for teaching and coding together.

The notebook is the perfect tool because it is built as an interactive web application that allows us to develop and run our code block by block and immediately see results without worrying about installing additional software packages.

The reason it is called **notebook** is because it can contain live code, rich text elements such as equations, links, images, tables, and so on.

### Create a Jupyter Notebook

When you open a link to a Jupyter Notebook, you will see a dashboard. Here, you can see some important features that are labeled in red, for example, a Main Menu, a Folder Tree, a Tools Ribbon and a Canvas. Take a moment to explore the main functionalities of the Jupyter Notebook web interface.

Next, open the notebook Jupyter\_Notebook\_Markdown\_Guide.ipynb, which has already been created for you. Doubleclick the name of the Notebook in the File Data Tree, to the left of your screen.

Let's look at the existing cells.

Let us run the existing cells.

#### To run the code or renter the markdown in the notebook is simple, just press Shift + Enter.

The most important thing to know is that Jupyter notebook uses _cells_ and the different types. The _cell_ is a place where you can write your code or text. Cells can be run one at a time. You will be practicing this way of running and testing your code throughout the course. Two important cell types are _code_ and _markdown_. The _code cell_ is where we type or paste our code and can run the code in it. The _markdown cell_ is a place you can type descriptions such as _pseudocode_(we will get to that later) in rich text format, see the following figure as an example. You can search for _‘Markdown cheatsheet’_ to get a quick start with markdown.

#### Create a new notebook and give it the name "hello\_world.ipynb"

Let us create a new Jupyter Notebook and practice creating cells.

And open the new notebook.

Now create a _code cell_ and type the following code:

print ('Hello CSD2! )

![](https://github.com/BlockResearchGroup/CSD2\_2022/blob/20676eaf165a73675433f284799f874a45835718/2\_Geometry/Introduction/Files/Introduction/IntroToJupyterNB\_Slide%208.png?raw=true)

```python
print ('Hello CSD2!!')
```

```
Hello CSD2!!
```

### Downloading your notebook

To download the currently-open notebook go to the **Main Menu > File > Download**

![](https://github.com/BlockResearchGroup/CSD2\_2022/blob/20676eaf165a73675433f284799f874a45835718/2\_Geometry/Introduction/Files/Introduction/IntroToJupyterNB\_Slide%207.png?raw=true)

### Save and export the notebook

To save and export the currently-open notebook locally go to the **Main Menu > File > Save and Export Notebook As**

![](https://github.com/BlockResearchGroup/CSD2\_2022/blob/20676eaf165a73675433f284799f874a45835718/2\_Geometry/Introduction/Files/Introduction/IntroToJupyterNB\_Slide%206.png?raw=true)

### Close a notebook

If you close the notebook browser tab, the notebook actually is not closed, it is still running in the background. To close the notebook completely, right-click the name of the notebook you want to close and select 'Shut Down Kernel'.

#### Ok, now you have the basic knowledge to launch and run a Jupyter notebook, and it is time to continue to learn Python.
